# Hi there, I'm Shyam Maurya 👋

**AIOps Engineer** | Prayagraj, India 📍

I'm passionate about bridging AI and IT Operations, currently diving deep into **Agentic AI** systems and their applications in operational intelligence.

## 🔧 What I Work With

### Core Technologies
- **AI/ML**: Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, LangChain, GenAI frameworks
- **Cloud & Platform**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Google ADK
- **Agentic AI**: Multi-agent systems, Autonomous workflows, LLM orchestration
- **MLOps/LLMOps**: MLflow, Kedro, Model versioning, Pipeline automation
- **AIOps Stack**: Monitoring, Observability, Incident automation, Predictive analytics
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD pipelines

### Current Focus Area: Agentic AI 🎯
I'm exploring and building autonomous AI agents that can:
- Self-organize and collaborate to solve complex operational problems
- Make intelligent decisions with minimal human intervention  
- Learn from system behaviors and adapt strategies
- Automate incident response and root cause analysis

## 🚀 Professional Interests

I work across the entire AIOps spectrum:
- **Observability & Monitoring** - Building intelligent monitoring systems
- **Incident Management** - Automating detection, response, and resolution
- **Cost Optimization** - AI-driven resource management and optimization
- **Security Operations** - Anomaly detection and threat intelligence
- **Performance Engineering** - Predictive scaling and optimization

## 💡 What I'm Learning

Currently expanding my knowledge in:
- Advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architectures
- Multi-agent orchestration patterns
- Vector databases and semantic search
- Edge AI deployment strategies
- Google's latest AI/ML tools and frameworks

## 🎯 Projects & Contributions

### Agentic AI for IT Operations
Building autonomous agent systems that can monitor, diagnose, and remediate infrastructure issues without human intervention. Leveraging LLMs and custom agents for intelligent decision-making.

### Intelligent Log Analysis
Developing ML pipelines for real-time log anomaly detection and pattern recognition using unsupervised learning techniques.

### Predictive Capacity Planning
Creating forecasting models that predict resource requirements and automatically scale infrastructure based on historical patterns and business events.

*More projects coming soon as I migrate and document my work...*

## 📚 Beyond Tech

When I'm not coding or architecting AI systems, you'll find me:
- 📖 **Reading** - Always have a book in hand (tech, philosophy, or fiction)
- 🥊 **Boxing** - Great way to stay sharp, both physically and mentally
- 😄 **Humor** - Life's too short to be serious all the time!

I believe in continuous learning and the power of AI to transform how we manage and operate complex systems.
